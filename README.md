# RGSSAD Online Viewer

A web viewer to inspect the contents of RPGMaker XP and RPGMaker VX archives.
This will perform all operations locally on your computer; no backend necessary.

## Guide

To start, either drag-and-drop an archive into the dashed area or click within the dashed area to open a file prompt.

If the archive loads successfully, you will be able to the the preview screen.

At the top-left, there is a button called "Export Zip".
This will download the contents of the archive as a ZIP for easier inspection.

There is a file tree viewer on the left-hand side.
Clicking a directory will expand it, and clicking it again will minimize it.

Clicking a supported file will open a preview of that file.
Currently, only jpgs, pngs, and bmps can be previewed.
